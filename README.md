# Links

A careful reader is always happy to get a pointer to new book and in mant occasions the source
of the knowledge is a different book! Usual way to get this information is bibliography,
however unfotunately it does not always exist in books and sometimes what you have is not
a direct link, but just a brief mention, parody, allusion of sorts which can be intruiguing
but at the same time really hard to identify. And this is where community steps in!

Let's compile a list together. Every contribution is welcome, every book has a right to
be here. Not only book, movies, songs or any other media is welcome too!

## Contributing

All contibutions are done as merge requests. If you want to update a book to add / remove
links, just edit a relevant file and do changes there, all added links should have a reference
to the pull request to have discussion there, see the structure section

Have you found a way to scrape bibliographies and generate files in a necessary format?
That's great! We don't really care how you composed your set, as long as it's not copywrited.

If you add new books, you don't have to create a merge request per book, it can be done in
bulk. Thank you for the conribution!

## Structure

Media types are defined in a [types.json](types.json) file. Every item there should
have `code`, `title`, `comment` and `policy` fields. `code` defines the folder name
to put the book , `title` is a human readable title in English, `comment` describes
the kind of media that should be put in this section, and `policy` defines the way
files should be composed, e.g. naming, priorities etc.
